# My layout for the Draculad 36 keyboard
Welcome, keyboard nerds! This is my personal layout for my custom Draculad build. If you are not familiar with Draculad, it's a 36 split open-source keyboard. [Here](https://github.com/MangoIV/dracuLad) you can find more info about it.

My layout makes use of the home row mods approach, where all the modifiers (Alt, Ctrl, GUI...) rest in the main row of the keyboard, avoiding unnecessary movements of the hand.

Also, as an avid gamer, I made a layout to play games with just one half of the keyboard (leaving more room for some mouse action). When the _GAME layer is activated, all of the left half keys are moved one column to the left and one row down, making WASD movement and number keys more accessible.
